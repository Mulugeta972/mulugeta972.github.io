# About Me

This repository explores the integration of Primavera P6 project controls with Python-based data analytics, aiming to bridge traditional project management and modern analytical methods. It focuses on using historical project data to forecast potential schedule delays, cost overruns, and high-risk activities. Future updates will include Jupyter Notebooks, datasets, and visualizations demonstrating how predictive analytics can enhance project planning, Earned Value Management (EVM), and decision-making. This project reflects my ongoing journey as a Data Analytics student applying data-driven insights to real-world project control challenges.
