Primavera P6 + Python Integration: Data Analytics for Project Controls

As a Data Analytics student, my goal for this project is to bridge the gap between traditional project management software and modern analytical techniques. Using Primavera P6 schedules and historical project data, I apply Python to transform raw information into actionable insights.

What this repository demonstrates:

Data Extraction & Cleaning — Parsing complex.XER files to retrieve schedule and cost data.

Custom Analysis — Developing Python scripts for trend detection, performance indicators, and anomaly detection beyond standard P6 reports.

Informed Decision-Making — Creating dashboards, reports, and visualizations that support faster and better project management decisions.

Jupyter Notebooks:
Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the analysis and visualizations will be uploaded in the notebooks folder
 as the project evolves.

This project is a work in progress, reflecting my journey in applying data-driven insights to real-world project control challenges.
