    <h2>A Data Analytics Approach to Project Management with Primavera P6 and Python</h2>
    <p>As a data analytics student, my goal for this project was to bridge the gap between traditional project management software and modern analytical techniques. This repository demonstrates my work in using Python to integrate with Primavera P6, showcasing my skills in:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>**Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Parsing complex `.XER` files to extract key project data.</li>
        <li>**Custom Analysis:** Developing custom scripts to perform advanced analyses beyond standard P6 reports.</li>
        <li>**Informed Decision Making:** Creating intuitive reports and visualizations that support project managers in making better, faster decisions.</li>
    </ul>
